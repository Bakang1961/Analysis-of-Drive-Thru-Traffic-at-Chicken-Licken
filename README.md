The project aims to develop a program that analyzes traffic flow data collected from a fast-food restaurant's drive-thru option. The data is logged in a file that contains the number of cars passing during each ten-minute interval from 8 am to 10 pm. The program loads the file into three arrays and calculates the average number of cars per ten-minute interval throughout the day. It also identifies the three highest counts and their corresponding times. The results are displayed to the user, which can be used by management to allocate resources during peak times. The program is implemented in C++ and uses file input/output and array manipulation to perform the analysis.
The method used in the project is based on reading the data from a file and processing it using arrays. The program calculates the average count and identifies the three highest counts by sorting the data in descending order based on the count. The program is designed to be efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for use by expert programmers.
The results of the project show that the program is effective in analyzing traffic flow data and identifying peak times. The average count and the three highest counts provide useful information for management to allocate resources and improve customer service. The program can be further improved by implementing alternative approaches such as keeping track of the three highest counts while reading the data from the file.
